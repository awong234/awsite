Dreamt there was a bat in our house, but we lived in a swampy watery place. Or
perhaps it was field work of some sort. Lisa and I looking throughout the house,
came across giant snails, other creatures before finding the bat cuddled with
the cats.

We wanted to remove the bat because of rabies, but I said it was too adorable to
be removed.
