I’m resting. Looks like a parking lot or something. Shujie walks by; shes
returned to progressive but now shes some chief financial officer type. Shes
leading a cadre of workers talking some business stuff about the company.

On a flight. Ask flight attendant if we’re able to pick up radio transmission
from jets behind us. Alex shakes his head no — I suppose thats not how light
works here. The attendant wants to know the time, and she says “oh thanks,
Mickey” to her Disney themed watch.

I’m trying to solve a neural network in my head. This causes issues with
reality, because next thing we know we’re adrift in the ocean. A giant ice block
floats by, as big as a boat, it looks like a bunch of ice rectangles stacked on
top of each other. Later there are more of them, and they’re moving very quickly
toward us. We narrowly miss one, and more are coming. Matthew panics and flips
out of the raft; I’m yelling at him to help paddle because one is headed
straight towards us.
