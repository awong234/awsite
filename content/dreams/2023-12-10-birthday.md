Having an event at a big fancy hotel, it’s our birthday and another’s (maybe a
cousin). I find some sort of neat peanut beer and id like to enjoy it. We sit
and talk about getting speakers to play music, they seem to have space. Not sure
if we’re in someones house right now.

Someones asking about taxes. Matthew apparently has begun to be a tax
professional because hes answering questions with lisa. Someone says, well you
really ought to be hiding money and skirting the law because then the
organizations trust you with more money, right? I’m sure lisa disagreed.

We’re gathered in a big central hall. Someone puts on a sort of hologram ar
display of a race among us babies. I lose.

We turn to go to the next event. Not sure where it was. Slowly things begin to
crumble. The hotel is palatial with grand egyptian statues towering overhead.
Not strange at first, but increasingly worrying. At some point my brother and I
get separated and I look in horror as he tries to safely get across a walkway
that is collapsing. I try to follow once things have settled, he is a small
figure in the distance climbing rubble. As I near, he pulls up in his green
subaru to drive us away, I pile in, exhausted. The door slides like a minivan
though.
