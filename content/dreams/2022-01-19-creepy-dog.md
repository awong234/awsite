Creepy dog in an abandoned facility. I was climbing down for some reason, passed
a creepy Pokémon dog that was attacking me, but slowly. Maybe shooting slow
projectiles. It was saying some weird stuff.

Lisa was nearby, drowsily telling me about her brothers friends and how they’re
the type of people who don’t have the latest game system and can’t be expected
to run spider man. She asked if I had put all my Pokémon away.
