Driving a car into a market.

The first initial setup is some medieval castle thing where you can drive up to
your own castle. Looked like a paintball map.

We got out and walked. Many vendors with lots of good food. Someone thrust a bun
into my hands and told me the price was “.50 more than 1” and I agreed but was
having a hard time keying the amount into the system. A white guy was getting
impatient behind me. After the sale I followed him and said some racist things.

I sat down with Nick Bongiovanni to enjoy the food and we caught up. Apparently
he’s been learning Taiwanese with the other person seated at the table and was
tested to say something along the lines of “we hope you enjoy the festivities”.
He did well. I was embarrassed I hadn’t practiced mandarin more.

On some sort of train car. I get up to let some elderly people sit. I see Ming
and Anna asleep in a room on the train thing, and children were trying to wake
them, but could not. I get the sense most of these people were family.
