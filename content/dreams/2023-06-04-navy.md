Neighborhood of some sort. Logitech security cameras can show stats of
individuals. One dude arrives and begins terrorizing the neighborhood, his
strength stat is super high (43, apparently super high). His appearance is
incongruent; a lanky white boy who carried an electric guitar around.

In the navy. We’re on an exercise pulling fishing gear owned by the government.
It’s some sort of deep sea fishing operation. I fall overboard. Fortunately the
swim back is not difficult, but I’m motivated to get back because they discharge
sailors who fall overboard. The captain is a hard ass.

An old classmate (Austin Kim?) with someone else arrives by motorcycle. We catch
up. He is older, middle aged, wearing a suit.
