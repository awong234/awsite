Dreamt BCS finale. Finale looped into beginning of bcs. Saul was going to do one
last score relitigating some medical bills. He does something wild, gets up on a
lamp pole making faces into a building. Apparently in the beginning of the show
the faces are goofy but in the finale they’re pained, we guessed that it was
because we knew jimmy’s problems and troubles now.

Ceiling panel with thorny vines coming out. I had a huge saw you cut them down.
Thought about pulling down everything through the ceiling; went through with it
but patching too hard so I reversed in time to start over.

Went to live rupaul show. Happening all over the city, have to walk between
acts. Song & dance happening at a fountain. Perspective changes to camera
tracking performers. I think fucking eureka was performing.
