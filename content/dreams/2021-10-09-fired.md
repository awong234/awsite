Got fired from work because of depression, could not maintain the facade.

Laura Naccarato from high school was there, she had done some sort of medical
procedure on me as a favor but i couldnt accept it so i paid her $200.

Jason Mendoza from the good place was my brother and had some legal documents
saying he was entitled to all the money i made at progressive. I signed it over.

Went to work at an ice cream shop or something. began to come out of the
depression, started cleaning up the car/bus i was on. Picked up wrappers and
such as well as a tomahawk steak and put it in the bin.

Started talking at the customers at work, told this lie about my father's
business and how we had rebranded and stuff (there was no business).
