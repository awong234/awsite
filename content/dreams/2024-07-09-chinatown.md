Lisa and I in NYC. We see the hill to my grandmas house. A boy like McCauley
Caulkin is trying to get up the hill but keeps sliding back down. I say it’s a
30-40ft climb, quite steep.

We come out of the train station near chinatown. Lisa asks me if we had
kidney(liver?) dumplings before, I said no but I didn’t care to try it. We
double back because I knew there was a car we could use. Seemed like someone’s
custom built roadster. We speed off and as we pass a building, the whole side of
it starts peeling off.
