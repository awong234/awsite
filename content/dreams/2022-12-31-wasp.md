With my family somewhere. I make a racist joke to my father, swapping the e for
a Jews to Jaws. He didn’t laugh.

Very suicidal early on. With my family, I break a wine bottle to cut myself with
it. Family doesn’t try hard to help.

Practicing defense like a video game. Particular class lets one take down bugs
easier.

A giant honey comb breaks a tree limb from limb. Parts land on an AC unit. Bugs
start entering the house. Lisa untroubled.

I grab a click lighter, and try to defend the house with it. I kill a few bugs(
which are all shapes and sizes) including a really big white wasp. Then bugs
start reacting to the heat and jumping at me. I awake.
