Daniel hahn drinking a sprite. Something unfair.

Andrew, dad and Matt trying out a game I found. Must have been futuristic VR.

We’re astronauts. I’m testing out whether they’d have the heart and skills to
save someone in space or something, but it changed to whether they can save
themselves. I put a button on their controller to slow down the velocity of
their derelict, and a twist to stop the rotation. I was supervising; Andrew and
dad stopped spinning, but Matt was having trouble. We joked for a moment until
his situation spiraled out of control, and his craft broke apart. He was headed
toward the planet, we were in fairly low orbit. I awake.
