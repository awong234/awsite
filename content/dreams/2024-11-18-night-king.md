An entity wants to kill people by tricking them. They can get out if they’re
perceptive, but mainly it is kill it before it kills you.

Mark is flying in to meet me and some friends. Maybe work friends, ruth is
there. Maybe this is a team building opportunity.

On a roof, matthew is locked in with a climbing hook, I’m holding onto him until
I can get up. It looks like a supermarket shelf. Someone comes by and
antagonizes me, turns out it was the monster in disguise. I was tricked and had
to be saved.

Last encounter, it asks me if I have a motto — I dont really so it stabs me with
a surgical scalpel on a stick, and follows up with whether I like sports
unironically or something — I manage to trap it in a container somehow and mark
it with a big N and skull and crossbones. I throw it towards others I know to be
more capable in dealing with it. Was it Joe Tesoro from high school?

In an airbnb or something, trying to get moms car down a sloping curving
driveway, but it’s snowy and icy. The car slides off the curve of the driveway,
into some trees. My dad admonished me that he always buys winter tires (he does
not irl).
