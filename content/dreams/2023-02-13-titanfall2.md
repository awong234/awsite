Dreamt Lisa and I prepping for Christmas. On line waiting to mail letters.
Letters sent by teams now. Long line through narrow corridor. Get to postal
agent and she informs us of the absurd price. I get mad. We return home through
thick snow. Neighbor is a strange place.

I’m driving my Corolla. Near grandmas apartment. Something bad happens and some
crazy fucking lady tries to get into my car. I speed away up the hill, stopping
between two people. I convince them to find out what happened with the scary
lady. Hae Kim was being trafficked in a block of ice.

We end up finding where Hae Kim is (supposedly murdered) and can rescue her.
She’s down in a ice mine, we could totally go save her if we wanted because
everyone else is on leave and nobody is working.

We slide down the ice tunnel, and everything is melting. We’re dumped out onto a
river, and our tech locates hae in the water. She is alive and we save her. We
bring her to land, where the Titan from Titan fall 2 was there. We power up his
battery (someone says 39% just enough to translate emotions) and the Titan
starts talking. Suddenly he falls over and fucking dies. Credits roll, this was
the game Titan fall 2 all along.

I turn to Lisa who is incredulous at how abruptly the game ends. I note trouble
in development causing a rushed product.
