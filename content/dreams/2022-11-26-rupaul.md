Watching drag race with Lisa’s family. Most of them ignoring it.

Somehow Lisa and I are invited as contestants. I must have been favored somehow,
because some people recognized me, and I felt like I didn’t need the
introductory training.

Nevertheless we did the intro, which mainly centered on being goofy and improv.
I participated with one other and mostly let them do the improv, to weak
reception.

We’re getting ready for the first round, and I realize I don’t have any
womenswear. Am I supposed to go out and buy it all right then? I figured I
should drop out of the race, especially seeing as I’d have to shave my beard.
I’m dismayed, but at least Lisa could continue. Lisa shares a moment with Rupaul
referencing some 80s movie along the lines of beetle juice or some movie that
she loved and knew well. At least she didn’t have to buy any clothes (lol).

I must have decided to quit. My parents were at a hotel room upstairs. Walked by
my dad watching tv in a darkish room.

In a separate dream, I was participating in the race again. We were doing a mini
challenge, I was paired up with miss vangie. We were waiting our turn to string
some lights into some sockets. Someone mentions Scarborough, and Lisa at the end
of the line gesticulated at me. I told vangie I was a fan, and didn’t get to
tell her in the previous time I’d seen her in a dream.
