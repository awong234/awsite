Twitch was alive, in a tank, but with some very large (for the tank) bipedal
parasite monsters. I’m not sure who arranged this. I witnessed a parasite
monsters accosting twitch, and then saw twitch’s belly was open, entrails
hanging out. The monster slurped up the entrails. I think I tried to reload a
previous save game to fix the situation.

# IRL Context

Twitch was a goldfish I had from 2009 to 2023
