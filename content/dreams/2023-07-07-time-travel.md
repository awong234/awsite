In a dorm. Walking to my room. EMTs are there, want to see me. They load me onto
a stretcher, place a pair of bright orange boots onto my legs, which immediately
chill ice cold and freeze in place, locking my legs. We stay and talk for a
while.

Second part. Romeo + Juliet on set. Tarantino directing. One of the actors flubs
his lines (I have the script) while he pilots a drone to creep on a girl. I ask
Lisa if Tarantino directed it this way. Anyway they bring guns out with a
spotlight on the gunbearer, I guess Romeo and Tybalt are going to duel. Or
something.

It’s 1967, although I have no reason to think it is. I am trying to fix some
electrical panel. There is a wire hanging loose with visible blue electrical
fire coming off of it. I’m thinking I should be very careful when touching it,
but when I grab it it takes hold of me and I cannot let go. I am fading to white
while I struggle against the electricity. When I finally release myself, I am in
the future, 2167 or something.

Third part. In the future. People can all astral project. I can immediately
astral project too, I attempt it. I return to my body. I’m in someone’s house. I
look outside , it is blustery and dark but I can see some very old people in
chairs outside, apparently projecting themselves. People are arriving home. A
Latin woman in a maxi dress is projecting. I reach out to touch her, she grabs
my hand; apparently you can touch other peoples ghosts and are aware of them,
and they are aware of you.
