Drifting through space outer wilds style, nothing but my suit and its thrusters.

I’ve taken it off because it was hot, have to rush to get it on because a friend
notified me we had to land soon.

In the distance, a large skeleton not unlike the anglerfish, with a white hole
in its mouth. Apparently we needed to find some organism that gave us something
to get into the skeleton.

Landed on the planet, I’m sneaking around with the friend. Come up to a bunch of
thugee cultists around a railway. Wait in darkness until they leave. Ants
swarming our little alcove. My friend decides to have lunch, shows me that they
added carrots to their soup. Friend is seen by the cultists.
