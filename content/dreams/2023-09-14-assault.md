I was in school. It was winter, but early winter. I was wearing my super heavy
coat with the fake fur lining the hood, from high school. I had it all zipped up
and my rabbit fur hat on too.

A bunch of black kids started making fun of me, saying it wasn’t that cold, what
was I gonna look like when it’s -10. I said, if I want to be warm, I’m gonna be
warm!

Went home. Some little asian kid jumps me, and I judo flip him into the ground.
He’s showing a fencing response, so I call 911. Interestingly enough I can
recall seeing the digits 911 appear on my phone; usually digits are scrambled.

EMTs arrive, and I tell them how I was attacked. Police never show up. They cart
away the kid. One of the EMTs must have become my friend because he decided to
stick around in case I get assaulted again.
