Acting out or watching some movie. Something about a disease/mental illness
transmissible that causes you to kill things. Something about dried up chicken
pieces. Last seen is a boy squishing a snail on his desk.

Some sort of large pool. Ben Augustine is there training as a rescue diver. I
fall in, narrowly avoiding a set of robots beginning a swimming race, and he
fishes me out; felt more like a bungee jump, I don’t know why there was so much
gravity involved. He tries to land me near where the robots jumped off, but we
jumped way too high out of the water and that seemed dangerous so we landed back
in the pool, on an edge. I just swam and got out. There were various maggots and
larvae on the floor when we got out, he mentioned he tries to make sure he
shakes them off as much as possible. We’re both disgusted.

Rob asks to play halo at the very end, he was playing mw2. I’m picking up some
sensible weapons to work with, telling Lisa where I’ll be as I do so.
