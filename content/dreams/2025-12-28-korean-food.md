Was trying to get Korean food for my family. At first I think it was just for
me, for class.

Order took forever. I just got something ordinary but they never finished it. I
went to the back and asked whoever was there how long. They kept saying a few
more minutes. I asked what they had done so far. They wouldn’t answer.

I hung out with one of the guys in the back, trying to get him to have
compassion, asking him how he’d feel if after his shift he waited two hours for
food. He said maybe dont come here next time and or leave early. I said I gave
the place a pass because they usually werent this long and are the only Korean
place nearby.

A few classmates show up and take their orders away. I’m incensed. These are
people *in my group* how could they get their orders so fast we probably ordered
at the same time, but I know I ordered way before them?

I give up and go home. We check our freezer and my dad suggests we have the
pizza (which is laying out of the box on the freezer floor) followed by some
strange pie. I reluctantly agree. There’s nothing else to eat except some
expired food someone else left (alongside their clothing).

My dad is trying to shove lots of spaghetti down the toilet. I’m wondering why
they didn’t just dump it outside. It is slowly going down though, bit by bit.
