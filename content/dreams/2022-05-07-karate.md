Dreamt I was fighting some Asian dude in karate, my nemesis or something.
Winning 7-6 and then the world sort of shifted.

We were in a house or a bar, second floor. Balcony right outside. My things were
right by the door. I tried to be friendly with a child-person outside (adult but
I was treating them like a child) and handed them a bag out of my things. They
immediately lit a fire with some matches. I took the things away from them in
case they started a fire.

We move on. I remember thinking that this was death, the afterlife, and the
vague sense of less control and clarity over my actions and vision that improves
with experience. There were those who have maximized control.

Stop by a group of actors/actresses. It’s after shooting wraps, and they’re at a
picnic table in another covered balcony. One woman is saying how she never wants
to work with (Dr. #####) again, played by Henry winkler. He looks affronted.
