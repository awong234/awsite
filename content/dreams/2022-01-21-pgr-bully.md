Bully at PGR. Was manishi there?

Some offsite trip, tropical.

Big white dude kept coming up to me wanted to punch me. I asked what he gon do.
Get into fight like cobra Kai.

After hours I see from his perspective he starts to make a presentation to one
up me at work. Ends up showing that we’re all fucked and the business going to
fail. Settle this miyagi do style.

I set aside my differences and give advice on presentation, the dude used like
10 minutes of call of duty clips to get his point across. Told him it’d be
better received and respected if he focused on the theory, no more than a minute
of jokes.

Bully respected that, told me not to stay late at the office/workplace. LaRusso
starts talking about defense.

Earlier in the dream, I think family at grandmas house.
