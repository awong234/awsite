I dreamt of a town built into a mountain. Unspeakable horrors were beneath the
mountain, and the town had commissioned droids to fight the horrors and keep
them at bay.

I ask the local scientist to explain the physics of the darkness spell.
Something went wrong, the droids were overrun, the horror escaped. We had to
sneak around helldivers style to avoid enemies, some of whom were automotons
from helldivers.

Ian and Robert pulled off an objective that covered the town in lava. We got an
achievement for destroying another town and the lives within like we did with
Last Light. Unsure if this is what we were intending.

Everything was burnt ash after. A couple of boomer men approached and tried to
fight. We fought for a time with unloaded long guns, sticks at that point,
before they subdued me and I had to use a wide AOE death spell to escape.
