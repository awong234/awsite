Dreamt that I had something potentially dangerous, maybe a knife. Some guy told
me “rules say anyone with a stutter doesn’t get to have that, but you speak ok”.
I ask who made that rule, and he replies Jesus. I’m incensed and try to find the
passage where God turns water into poison. It doesnt exist IRL but neither does
his quote.

Lisa and I argue with the guy, now accompanied by a woman. After some time I
apologize to the woman, while struggling to turn off this video or game on an
ipad. I just want to figure out why they’re setting these fake Jesus rules.
