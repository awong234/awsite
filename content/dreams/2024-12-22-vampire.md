“What we do in the shadows” type situation, but less funny.

I live in a house with several other vampires. Unsure if I’m one myself,
probably.

Go to disneyland, I use a dream-like trance to determine if I want to go on a
motion ride. Nope, still not for me.

Some freeloader is lighting fires and digging tunnels outside our building. The
neighbors get upset.

My PC is out of its case, propped up precariously on a table. Some audio wire
with clips connects two parts of the motherboard. I’m fiddling with it during
commercials to get the sound quality right.
