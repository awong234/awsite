I was taking a class in nyc, possibly through Cornell. During the class we get
notified that there’s a gargantuan flood heading our way. Lisa and I find a box
truck to try to get out of the city. She drives us to one of the tunnels, but
she’s cursing and tries to turn around; i ask if she meant to take us here.
Clearly a tunnel isn’t the best place to be during a flood.

She parks the truck and we find the nearest building to try and get to roof
access. We run through the halls. Someone runs by us with a toaster oven and
locks himself in a room. Lisa runs ahead. I hear the man sliding the chain lock
closed but then keeps sliding it back and forth.

Someone approaches from behind. I recognize her from the class luckily. I ask if
she has permission to be here; if we could stay too. The man in the room was her
companion and came out of the room.
