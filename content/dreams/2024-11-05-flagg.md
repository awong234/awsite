Flagg is a supernatural power from The Stand. Dreamt he was challenging me and
using my cpap was not a good idea. I took it off.

Later dreamt of an animal at night, something with blades on its front to
eviscerate. I was tasked with putting up something I can’t remember what, and
needed to cut through a fence to do so. I left the area and came back at night.
To return I had to duck through the portion of fence id cut but honestly it was
a big portion. Walking to a tree stand I figured would provide safety for the
night, one of those animals attacked me.
