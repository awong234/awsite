In school, doing some sort of visual presentation. I was chosen by my group to
dress in a womans hat and dress to present. My parents were there. I was
uncomfortable but tried to be a team player. Nevertheless I was very cold and
snippy to my teammates talking to me as I tried to get dressed.

I get up to the front and mom gets upset. I sit back down, defeated. The people
trying to get me to do this were pikachu face surprised and were saying how it
was the worst thing, how they were so sorry it happened.

I listened to the rest of the presentation. Apparently I was supposed to do this
and *not* present on something like physics, because existing bias would give me
a higher grade, and so by sacrificing my grade and selection of content I would
level the playing field for others who wanted to present on things like this.

Ru Paul was there, perhaps the teacher, and was talking to my mother trying to
understand her disposition.
