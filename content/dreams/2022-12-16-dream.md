Silky nutmeg ganache was a libertarian and wanted to do away with orphanages. We
were in CA because I remember Lisa and her family were in the area. But then
again I think we were in a mix of CA, Nebraska, and Cleveland, because someone
else needed to get to campus 2, and I remarked I’d forgotten how close it was
(as in how close Lincoln is to Omaha, as if campus 2 was in one of those cities)

My brother suggested that the economy was crumbling underneath the surface and
gave some economic reasons why he thought so. This prompted silky to go off on
orphanages. I asked everyone if they knew any orphans; how could they be such a
burden when we don’t know any orphans, I said? Silky of course knew many
orphans.
