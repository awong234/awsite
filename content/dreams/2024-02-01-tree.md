Lisa and I planning a trip. One of our main concerns is traveling with a duffel
bag, will it be ok when it rains? We’re expecting torrential rains.

We’re living in the NYC house. We hear commotion outside. A tree limb snapped
off one of the trees. Unsure if anyone is hurt. I continue to make espresso,
because my contribution is that I can make good coffee regardless of
circumstance.

Trees continue to fall as rain increases. Trees start falling against the house.
People are shell-shocked, including my father and grandmother, I usher them
inside.

I say to Lisa someone doesnt want us going on the trip.
