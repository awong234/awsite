Driving two cars at once somehow. My acura and robert’s infiniti. I’m like
leapfrogging them? Or something— it’s not possible. Anyway i dont even have the
keys so I dont know how the cars were driving. I pull over the infiniti and ask
the cop if I can leave it there while I drive my car home and get the key to
Rob's car. The cop gets extremely upset and starts acting hostile.

Separate situation. I’m in line at what I believe is a pharmacy and I need to
pick up some things for a new mother. A tumbler and some baby formula I think.
After telling the pharmacist what I needed, she hands me a small vial that
looked like drops and a tumbler. Unsure if thats right I go to someone we both
know and ask if thats what was needed. Her name is “temple”. I show her the
items; the vial and the tumbler. In the sunlight I can now see the tumbler was
full of mold, and I drop it panicked.
