Dreamt we were moving. We had several apartments but we were moving out to a
house farther away.

One item of concern was id bought a relatively expensive tiny sports car with a
super futuristic interior. It was being stored in a basement of one of the
apartment buildings. I never got to use it because of various circumstances.

We went back to the old house to find the keys, which I eventually found.
Interesting set of keys, it seemed like it had many functions, and could be
opened and collapsed like a leatherman somewhat.

We returned to the electric car and prayed it still had charge after years of
neglect; it did. I got in and we started for the new place.

We drove through a sandstorm. No idea why or where this was but I remarked it
couldnt have been good for the glass and that the car should provide a HUD for
seeing through the storm.
