Dreamt I had borrowed some guns from alex. A cowboy pistol, a makarov looking
thing and a garand looking thing.

Id taken them with me to somewhere. Not sure if I was playing at a tuba
Christmas event but there were other tuba players. I leave my bag with the guns
in someones office for safe keeping, but I didn’t tell them. So next day I had
to sneak in there and get the guns.

I manage to get in and out. The person (dean I think) was preoccupied. I’m
traveling and meeting up with my mom so we can leave. The “dean” eventually sees
me but it’s gus fring from BB and he lets me off lightly. A cab takes me and
someone else to where I need to be. I offer to pay for the ride for the other
person, but the cabbie starts making things difficult. I just leave.

My mom and I are walking through a corridor. We get stopped so we’re waiting a
bit. Theres two other boys and their mothers. I turn around and the one boy is
playing with the hammer on the cowboy pistol. I freak out and ask if hes crazy,
wtf is he doing? Does he know how guns work? The boys seemed intent on playing
with the guns so I draw both pistols and cock them, saying they need to stay
back and not touch my guns. Stupid boys are laughing and still messing around.
Mom was talking or some stupid shit so I yell at her we need to leave now.

We see gus again, he says something ribbing me in spanish.
