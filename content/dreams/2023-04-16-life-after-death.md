Prior; driving my car through mountainous terrain in the rain. Started up a path
through a switchback but Google suggested it would take 3 months to get by. Able
to reverse time so I can get back to where I started. I recall a beach,
boardwalk.

For some reason I believed we were dead. After death is a shadow realm, a mirror
of the real world.

I’m at home with my family in ny. Not just my family though, some others there
too. Someone like Ivana? It’s thundering out, and we’re concerned about
electrocution. We know some advice is to minimize contact with the ground. I
jokingly lay face first on the ground. Other times we’ve got one foot on the
ground, one in the air and we’ve joined arms, as if some sort of lightning-proof
pose. I am concerned about my PC. I’m in my underwear.

The neighbors are moving, we can hear the scraping of chairs. They start moving
couches in torrential rain. They start and stop, often having to rush back in to
shelter. After some time I realize one of them must have some ability to reverse
their own time as well — they can experience the rain, its starts and stops,
and time the opening to get to their vehicle. They shout at us that we should be
helping. I run out there, as some sort of inspirational music is playing, and
tell them what I realized, congratulating them. The one who could rewind time
looked like Carla from scrubs.

Later, separately: some train thing, schedule operators.

Later I was Arnold swarzenegger and I was getting cast for a role or something
and I was eating chips and dip while I waited. Some people were coming so I
decided to move the food into the break room instead of in the acting space.
