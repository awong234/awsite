I wake up from a dream to tell lisa on the couch about how I dreamt about the
basement and how I thought I neglected some animals in aquaria down there. Then
two dogs come in (a medium black dog and a little scrappy white dog) and I ask
lisa...what have we been feeding the dogs?

The answer is I was neglecting the dogs too. The little scrappy dog was sitting
in the sink in our living room on a dish floating in some water when I saw it
had slices in it like a poorly carved turkey. I ran some warm water over it, but
it fell in, and when I went to retrieve it to my horror I pulled out only bones
and the fleshed head. I think there was another medium white dog in the water,
dead perhaps.
