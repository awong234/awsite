On a time study. We’re tracking this person. Theyve got a rabbit?

Gathered at work event. Many in attendance. On a big lawn together. Steve and an
unknown lady talking about business? Someone says it’s hard to describe to
people what we do, in a sort of dismissive way. I look around (suddenly we’re at
Ania’s house) and offer that it’s really not, we just maximize what we take from
the customer, and minimize accidents (I really meant minimize what we pay for
the accidents). Later I also add — to myself — we also maximize customers. I
think I saw Nathan Breitch there.

Andrew’s also here. I’m angry for some reason. Mark Motheral is making eggs and
some sort of waffle bread thing. Makes me a plate. The eggs were clearly
uncooked, raw eggs sitting in a bowl of bread, and apparently I’ve been making
off-handed jokes all night and joked that mark couldn’t make eggs. I go to throw
the plate out; Andrew says he’ll eat the eggs, and I feel wasteful throwing it
out. Mark is offended, he’s doing his best, starts getting mad at me; I
apologize and say I’ve been in a bad mood. Not sure if we resolved things.

It’s announced there’s a DND sword fight tournament in another location, so
everyone gets up to leave. Except me. I stay behind and begin ripping my arm
open with a knife, very depressed. Very graphically opening wounds on the top of
my arm. I don’t go deep, I stay at the surface, but enough to draw lots of
blood. I wake up. I feel a slight burning pain on my arm even awake for a few
minutes.

Advanced climate change has set in. Los Angeles is much colder and tehachapi is
frozen over. Me and Lisa’s family manage to take a train down south. We stay for
a bit, observing the people spending their last time at the ocean.

I must go back. I return north, and don my samus power suit. The north is
overrun with electric enemies including a giant electric worm boss. Luckily I
just beat Metroid prime and I’ve got plenty of weapons. I defeat the central
boss, and marvel that there are some people still here. Two men come out of a
ship with a dolly moving some goods. They don’t notice me. I follow them to some
sort of town hall.
