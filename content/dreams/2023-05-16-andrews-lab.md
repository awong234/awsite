Andrew constructing a crazy underground lab. Several stories underground. Single
wide shaft goes down. We visit “the post office” where there was a single
computer and router, and took 5 min to get down. Matt and dad were there too.
Andrew wanted me to spend lots of time doing some coding on this project (can’t
remember what the facility was for).

I ask if we could forward some ports so I can work remotely since it takes so
long to get down there (and secretly I’m afraid of what Andrew awoke in the
depths). Or if he was okay hosting the code on GitHub so I can push remotely. I
ask if the post office was the only place down there. Andrew chuckles and says
he didn’t want to reveal everything at once.

I look out the slats of the window, a brick retaining wall covers most, as we
were about garden level, but I can see greenery. Suddenly a loud rushing noise
comes from the shaft and we are instantly buried in rubble. Thankfully my dream
ceases before I can simulate any suffocation. Huge GTFO or back rooms vibes.
