A corpse is talking to me from a bed. His poster with Mona lisa eyes is in the
window. He is asking about a book, about raising the dead. I begin to talk to
him. My brother arrives. He tells me this person is of some notoriety. The
corpse is silent. Brother informs me the corpse had been trying to use me to get
the book so it can reanimate itself. I had been talking about giving it the book
to my brother earlier, not knowing it was a corpse, not knowing what it sought,
weighing the options. I am betrayed by the corpse. The eyes in the window follow
me.

Earlier playing SSB with Matthew, beat him w samus handily, he wanted to try
some of the new characters.

Earlier still, talking to a distinguished professor remotely. He had an R
package that lots of people wanted to see made more tidy friendly. He was
retiring and thus not very interested in developing it. Melancholy. I think we
offered to help.
