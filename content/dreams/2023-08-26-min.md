Hanging w min and Andrew. In Nevada, mins got some sort of ministry/army stuff
to do. Army is in the desert because they’re cleaning up old military waste
equipment. Looks almost post-apocalyptic, there’s old green machines piled up
high in the sand under old highway overpasses.

Min tells us about his troop leader / pastor who has an activity for us. It’s a
large invisible maze, and we are given sand to throw on it to navigate. Every
once in a while the maze is moved.

We must’ve gotten bored of that because we moved on to a knock-off Zelda game
where you play as the dragon. I jumped into water as the fire dragon and died, I
decide it’s dumb and go outside.
