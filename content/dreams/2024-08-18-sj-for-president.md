We decided SJ Ahn should cancel his bid for local government and run for
president. In an auditorium, kevin scrambled to get out his discord app and play
the “that’s great” clip.

Some weird survivor type game. Andrew and I and some odd people. One of them is
suicidal, and he is gonna jump off the roof. I drive against traffic to get
around the building to the roof, another goes separately. We make it and
restrain the guy, forcing him to do a split under a rail so be cant easily get
up. Back on the beach andrew complains about how he had to kill a small bird
egg, and how it’s unfair that teammates turned against him for that.
