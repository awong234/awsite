Dreamt my tooth cap fell off again. I dream this fairly regularly. I go to
Progressive's dentist, and I ask if I am supposed to be feeling anything in that
tooth. She says no, of course not. I feel the empty uncapped tooth, it has the
rough squishy texture of pulp.

The doctor readies her equipment. I’m concerned about anesthetic, but she’s
looking at X-rays and I shouldn’t need it. Why she’s drilling, I’m not sure, the
cap just needs to be reattached.

She leaves to do something. We’re actually on a rooftop, overlooking a street,
with a highway overpass beyond. The street is dirty, and filled with shambling
zombie-like homeless. I hear someone remark about some new policy NYC made that
removes a lot of money from the street, repelling the homeless. It doesn’t seem
to be working.

Down in the street someone is walking amongst the homeless. He looks like The
Man With The Golden Voice from the internet. I’m convinced it’s not an issue.
One of the homeless pulls out a modern arrow and stabs the man in the head with
it, right down the top of the skull. He pulls it out and tries to fight back,
but collapses. I am scared and crying, and as the dentist returns we explain
what happened. He worked for progressive apparently.

Sad portion of dream later about contemplating suicide.
