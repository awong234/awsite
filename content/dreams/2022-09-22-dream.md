Underneath our house is an old railway that we need to maintain. It’s only
enough space for a worker to lay down and pass Amazon deliveries I said. It must
have been bigger in the past.

Strange beautiful seascape underwater. It’s a sunken city and we’re on a mission
to fix some environmental issues.

We’re to plug some natural spore activity. However for whatever reason we aimed
to shower the plants with shredded credit cards. We get to the spot and mark it
with a beacon. It’s far too expansive to cover, we decide to leave it as we’d be
doing more environmental damage with the credit cards.

Beyond the end of the spore field is a small tv entertainment area, a door
frame, and a cathedral beyond. To the left outside the door frame are shelves of
broken aquaria.
