Dreamt lisa and I were watching pride and prejudice, but I had changed the
language settings to some weird one where they were still speaking english but
it was a totally different uninspired dub. I could not fix the sound.

We went to a pride and prejudice festival instead. Some high school friends were
there, and Tim Chen was doing standup. It was a mediocre set.

Gas was $60 a gallon inside the fair grounds. We had gotten bikes to move around
but they were kids bikes.
