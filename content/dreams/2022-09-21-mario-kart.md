Driving Izabele and team into a parking garage. She says “rev” like she wanted
me to rev my engine, but I think she was talking about the ticket dispenser
being broken. A key was inserted, and to get the gate up you just turned it. A
busted up blue Tesla was on the corner.

Met some guy incredibly good at Mario kart, a mutual acquaintance of someone
else. Exceptionally good. I had an older version of MK though. On my way out I
paused by them as they were practicing and fiddled with my own game. I shut it,
it was a game boy SP. Guy wanted me to put together a web app on MK stats for
him, calling out to me as I was leaving that the data should be dumped into a
database or something.

Fat black people passing by some Korean people selling food. They’re eating some
sort of yellow purée.
