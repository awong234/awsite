We inherited a GIANT house in NYC, but it was ancient and fairly run down. We
were trying to get to bed but there were a hundred light switches and many lamps
each sort of tied to something else; like one wouldn't go off unless the closet
was shut but it wouldn't shut.

I called my mom to see if she wanted it, perhaps to knock down and build a new
place on top. She said that she could not, as she had lovers in India and London
to attend to.
