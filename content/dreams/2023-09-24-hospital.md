Went to the hospital. Not sure the reason. One of the nurses is a guy, doing my
preliminary stuff. He asks if I’ve noticed anything unusual. I say no. He then
shows me my chart, and points to one of my tests, and says something like “well
this is obviously unusual” in a snarky way as if id failed his little test. I
got mad, and stormed off.

I decide I need to be seen by the doctors so I apologized profusely to the
nurse, even writing down my apology on paper before going to him. Something
along the lines of “I’m a bit of a hypochondriac and as soon as I got medical
insurance I started to go to the hospital for every little thing, so I’ve been
trying to rein that in but your comment isn’t helping.” He begrudgingly helps me
out, it’s several hours later and quieter in the room. I ask his name, since I
never got it before. He says something like it’s too late I’ve burned that
bridge, so I just look at my form. Looked Indian, started with a C, like
chandrathan or something like that.
