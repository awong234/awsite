At an art competition. The first contestant does something cool with spray paint
in the time allotted. Some sort of technique allowed him to spray a watermelon
texture onto a bicycle. It dried up super fast into the final color.

The next contestant was doing something crazy. A pair of pilots were drawn
beforehand, and she was going over some details with a black marker. She was
spending too much time on the details. She was tracing very faint details like
numbers reflected in the pilots helmets from the dashboard. Time was up, and she
hadn’t even begun painting. Somehow she gets extra time to do the painting, must
be in the rules. One of the announcers makes a joke, and I say “viscous
mockery!”.

We’re walking through town. Looks like a fairly desolate rural town. One of my
friends says that we are not connected to the internet, so we better not trigger
any transitions to other levels because we couldn’t load them. We say hi to a
lady who is glitched out and has no head. We’re in a building I recognize as my
own, because I see my compost bucket. It is not my home, just my building.
