Giant high school reunion in a swamp.

See people like Brian Jung, Julie Kim, other random people. Julie Kim in
particular says hi and it’s awkward. Some of the popular kids were living in
tents in expensive cities. I remember realizing that that could be a possibility
now.

I give out some computer puzzle, evidently I’m leading some of this. One guy
figures it out, it’s a puzzle that prints out some ascii art of a halo scene,
and when zoomed just right the moiree makes it look 3D. Others are having
trouble because they have macs and I coded it in git bash on windows.

Some guy looks like Sam benya from work but is probably that tall lanky kid from
middle school also played the trombone, think his name was Daniel C.

Some sort of game later where we’re reading lines or something. I get into a
irritating argument with another person, possibly another leader. Very public
and awkward.

Later walking back for meal, apologize to the guy. There’s some food in a case,
the attendant asks if anyone wants “weed meat” or something, looks like a Dead
Sea turtle. Everyone or most everyone says no. A girl ahead of us has the body
of a sea turtle, I could see her short tail swaying.
