Matt adopted a dog, a golden retriever. We were also set to board a cruise, and
somehow the cruise allowed dogs. But the dogs had to be checked a little like
luggage which meant you had to leave the dog with a bunch of other dogs and hope
they got it on board.

Problem was they didn’t, not for a long while. I sat outside boarding refusing
to go in until the dog was on board. But after too much time I decided I would
have to get on board.

I asked matt if they had boarded the dog; this must have been the next day
because he said they got the dog boarded after midnight. I was relieved but what
a crazy way to get dogs on board.
