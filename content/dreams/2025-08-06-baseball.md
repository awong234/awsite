I was trying out for a little local baseball game. It was a summer afternoon. I
had a buddy there too but I’m not now sure who it was. As my buddy was trying
out I was rummaging through my bags for my sunglasses. I had great difficulty
finding them. I did discover that this entire time I had put a playstation 1 in
the bag, and I saw a few SNES controllers too. Why they were there and why I was
lugging them around in my daily carry backpack I have no clue.

I gave up looking for my glasses and told the organizer I was ready, but he
called the day anyway.
