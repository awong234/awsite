On a rocket to Mars (?) with lots of people. Seems like a first flight for
colonists.

Delays due to something missing. Go down to nearest planet to find. Walking
across desert, drop phone go to look for it. Find Matthews phone and go back to
a camp/settlement, find Matt give to him. Find my own phone.

Local jawa like creatures present, taking our parts. Have to go rebuild a robot
or something but i don't have access to the fabricator, have to stand in line.
Materials look like wrapping paper tubes.

People back on ship getting impatient. Tory and Sam from cobra Kai there. Joined
cobra Kai in making a mess on the floor so Sam might trip.

Supposed to be many hours long flight, three hour descent. Never did make it.
