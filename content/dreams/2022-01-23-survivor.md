Dreamt a contestant on survivor

On a cruise ship, had to jump off into a bay, but this was an urbanized island.

Swam in the bay. Saw a Toyota boat that looked just like a Camry from the back.

Somehow watching the episodes in real time as I was playing. Saw some dude named
Deshawn say he swam by some “thin Asian dude” in confessional style and wanted
to reply, but I didn’t know how.

Ended up in a hotel room with several other contestants watching TV. Told them
about the weirdness of watching the episodes while I was contesting, if I didn’t
see a confessional made by myself it means I never decided to do it and that’s
it.

Everyone chilling on a California king size bed.
