Dreamt Angela led a mandatory sports team at work. I wanted to skip it. One of
her captains was coming by to collect me. I heard it suggested on the internet
to hook into some plant cyberpunk style and pretend i was really enjoying it and
say no I’m not who she was looking for (she didn’t know what I looked like
apparently). Told Andrew how it got out of sports duty, he laughed.

I wanted to skip because I had real work to do. Bryan Munch from work teams
chatted me about updating some excel report.
