Dreamt that I was getting into my car (6MT Corolla), which was basically under a
semi trailer, with the semi driver blaming me for the position. Started it up as
the semi departed, everything sounds like shit. My car reports that the last
attendant was some name with a J. Young black man walks up to my window — must
be J because he says he’s the one who wrecked the transmission. I get out and am
asking for his information and he runs away.

I walk up to several dudes and they’re confrontational, and I’m asking them to
just hit me already then. Nobody does.

I go to an office to see if they have info on J. Get in line, they don’t have
any info.

Scene changes. In school again, checking my tax history in an auditorium. Was
comparing my motorcycle’s insurance with Geico to my auto insurance with PGR to
show that PGR was cheapest, and realize I never paid for motorcycle insurance
last year. I go to the computer lab to pay. Some Asian kids were there hanging
out, playing a fighting game?. I get on the computer. Absolutely ridiculous
keyboard, 60% or less but seems to have had the letters spaced out in a weird
way. Not sure if I was able to pay the insurance. I don’t have a motorcycle in
real life.
