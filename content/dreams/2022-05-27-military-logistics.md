At Ania’s previous.

In the military, but basically doing field work, but in a suburb? Manual f250
truck was mine to use. Did some sql queries on org structure of the buildings in
the town. Severe flooding. Drove the truck down the road, we were evacuating.
Left a kayak or canoe by the side of the road, figured I should get it. Water
was very deep, so I tipped the truck on its side for whatever reason, thinking
it’d be easier to get the boat in. Others helping me out.

End up stranded for longer, people in the mountains still not fully evacuated.
