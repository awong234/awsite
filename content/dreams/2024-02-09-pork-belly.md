I dreamt that I was able to encode a physical piece of pork belly into a
computer system. It accurately represented the object’s fundamental nature. We
could use it to 3d print the pork belly and it appeared very natural, but we are
limited by the technology of our time to fully reproduce the food such that it
can be eaten. I presented the work to Ryan Haffey at work.
