Was playing borderlands with ian and alex. Last session didn’t save, and I knew
this because I had my grenade mod unequipped. We were supposed to have met Jesus
and “fought the cockroaches”.

Later, a party thrown by some people on a big hilly lawn. The host is trying to
do magic; I get called to participate. My card is the 7 of hearts. He pulls my
card correctly, but he says to look at the wall while he produces our card; not
very convincing.

Cockroaches skitter on the floor, as many as 5 at once. I’m mortified.
