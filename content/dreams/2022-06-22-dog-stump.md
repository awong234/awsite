I had the most horrific dream.

We were dog sitting for Ruth (she doesn't have a dog) and there was a bed in our
room and a piece of furniture upside down in another room. It had a metal cage
thing for storage that was exposed. The dog got the zoomies and took off,
tripping over the bed. In the next room we heard a crash; it had torn off its
front leg after getting caught up in the cage and was running around on the
bloody stump.

Later we were playing with grizzly bears in the woods, with paper on fishing
poles, as if they were cats. A few more bears snuck up behind us so we had to
run down slope as fast as we could.
