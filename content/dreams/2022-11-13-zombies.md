We’re pursued by a fleshy monster. I carry scissors to defend myself, but it’s
useless.

A titanic fleshy monster sits in a warehouse as we’re making our way to the
cruise ship. We have to go through to get on. There are more people on the boat,
and it seems more organized, but it is useless.

A nurse is treating someone. She remarks that this is punishment for all the
people she’s killed, and that we’ve all killed. She should speak for herself,
and I take the scissors and snap the base of her neck.

Zombies overrun the area. We’re on a cruise ship but they’re nuking the area
anyway. Couples near us were about to get married. I lament the situation as we
move out to the ocean, futilely.
