In band again. This time I’m assigned to play a strange bass or tenor guitar I
have no idea how to play. It’s electric too. Austin Kim from high school sits
next to me, but it’s more likely Dong meen. The conductor begins, and I’m
immediately lost. Dong Meen nudges me, whispering my name urgently. I don’t know
the notes or the hand positions, much less where we are. A solo is coming up;
Dong Meen takes the guitar out of my hands and starts to play the solo. I want
to die, I want something to kill me.

Earlier I think everyone had brought some snacks for the class. I brought
goldfish. For some reason I was under the impression it was bring your own
snack, so I was upset when someone started helping themselves to my goldfish,
but then turned around and saw everyone was sharing everyone else’s food. I
shrugged and let it go.
