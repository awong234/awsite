In china or something. Mustve bought an old palace. Everything, even the stairs
leading to the plaza were hewn by hand. Trying to grow things but it all turns
out as weeds like my backyard. I would like to raise cattle and goats and
chickens.

Some girl picked plants and I sit down to review and identify them.

Much later I invite my family over. Unsure what to make given no crops and very
anxious. Moms not helping. Matt is not helping. I get upset and break my
nebraska beer mug from undergrad to threaten my brother with. I dont think I
actually have it any longer in real life but I was so dismayed at having broken
it. I show the pieces to robert.
