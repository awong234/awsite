Lisa had to drop something off at someone’s house. It was a little bungalow,
very small appearing but actually spacious inside. Mostly a living room and a
bedroom.

We dropped off a note and I’m not sure what the note was. I was creeped out and
put the note and the key inside the house. I wasnt supposed to leave the key
inside but id locked it from the inside and I didn’t want to get locked in, too.

The bungalow must’ve been owned by some child actor turned reality star. I
remember knowing that she had an episode where she was swimming with sharks and
nearly drowned.
