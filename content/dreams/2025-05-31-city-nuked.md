At anias or some place similar. Lisa and I are watching a video my brother is
streaming from a baseball game in town on my phone. It’s probably new york, hes
probably in Queens at a mets game and we’re in harlem. I think we’re in the
dining room, looking towards the living room.

Lisa asks how I know the games going well, and I explain how I know. Maybe I
elaborate on how a pitcher striking everyone out is okay but it leaves nothing
for everyone else to do and maybe it would be good to spread the effort around
the team so the pitcher isnt the only one tired. But what do I know I dont
really care for sports.

We’re watching the game and we see a flash of blue light and hear Matt scream in
agony before the feed cuts out. The sky darkens and we understand immediately
the citys been bombed, nuked perhaps. I look outside and exclaim in horror as I
view a city on fire, a world on fire. Lisa asked perhaps if we should first get
a drink, as if the situation wasnt real, or as if things could improve, or if
there was somewhere nearby still normal. Where are we supposed to get a drink?
I’m dumbfounded. I wake.
