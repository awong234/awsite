Dreamt I was in for surgery. I think the surgery was just done for its own sake
because I cant see what it could have helped.

I was put under and the surgery involved attaching a connection between the
trachea and the nasal passage, but no I somehow got the anatomy wrong. The idea
was to allow the nose to bypass something, as if it had its own route to the
lungs distinct from the regular oral route. Anyway it involved dissecting the
“nose’s” trachea and connecting it to the “oral” trachea so that I could breath
through my nose while prepped for something else.

Something else never happened. Someone else accidentally got prepped the same
way, mistakenly, they thought I still needed prepping and they were me. The POV
goes first person, or it’s emphasized to be such so that I dont know if I’m
waking up as myself or this other person. But to nobody’s surprise I am myself.

I have a recollection of waking in the night (perhaps becoming awake in real
life) and telling Lisa that I’m under this procedure. Not sure if she responded.

I am in recovery. I cannot swallow because I guess by connecting the airways the
esophagus is blocked or something. I resist the reflex because I’m afraid it
will damage the preparation. I breathe through my nose and focus on that — I
cant inspire orally, again because I guess in this dream the “oral” trachea is
the esophagus and its connected to the trachea. Dont ask how it works.

The doctor comes to check on me in recovery and does a quick laryngoscopy
directly through the mouth. She at first thinks I should be recovering from the
completed surgery but apparently I’m still just “prepped” with this airway
connections. She realizes it and literally manually pulls the connection apart
and out of me, showing me what was inside me — a tube with a copper wire at the
end. I dont know how that was performing its function. Apparently when the
“tracheas” are re-aligned they just snap into place without the need for
reattachment. I’m grateful to be back to normal but horrified at the same time.

I wake irl with a very dry mouth.
