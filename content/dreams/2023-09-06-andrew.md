Dreaming I was inside a Battlebit match, but it was real. The enemy was swarming
our position. I call a supply drop down as last resort cover. I throw grenades
at several enemies, does not stop their approach. As they near me I have no
choice; I pull out a grenade and frighten them off with it, but it explodes in
my hand. Knowing I’m done for, I pull out two more grenades and put them at the
top of my head. I feel the first one go off, but not the second; presumably I’d
died.

Had to find someone to sit next to, like a school bus. A girl named “Open” had
an empty seat; I saw a coat that belonged to me in another seat so I sat there
instead. The guy who eventually sat next to “Open” called her something equally
dumb by accident, she got offended.

Mom going on about buying me a new car after I was talking about driving in the
UK. Andrew driving an old CRV. But the spare tire rack doubled as a cake serving
tool. It’s our last day and he’s driving us to the airport. Or I’m driving a
minivan I can’t remember; I stop at a set of benches so we can eat. All the
benches are at an angled up in the air, and the circular tables are lifted in
the air as well.
