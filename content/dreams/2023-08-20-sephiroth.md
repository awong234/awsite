At a conference with Cornell colleagues again, hybrid with a school summer camp.
I fly in to Bayside where it’s being held. Cat, Gerardo, DJ, and Angela are all
there.

I’m the morning we take a minivan to our destination. A king and queen ant were
wandering the cabin, but they both really looked more like termite queens, where
the “king” had big pincers, and the queen just had short pincers. I remark on
this to Angela when we see her.

At the event there are a lot of smart kids attending like it’s a summer camp.
We’re having a meal at a restaurant, and it’s mixed seating. DJ is near me, and
a kid. We ask the kid, if this cereal square was enlarged like 100x and you took
a bite, would it be more or less flavorful than the single one? (The original
question DJ asked of me was whether when you shrunk a t-shirt down to the size
of a cereal square, would it be more or less flavorful than it started, but I
didn’t want to confuse the kid).

After gathering they mention SSB is going on somewhere so I leave to go.
Beforehand I wash my hands in the bathroom. There are many faucets with a single
trough to drain.

Instead of SSB, we are instead role-playing a fight. I’m role-playing sephiroth,
and my enemy is some dude with two large sickles making a sort of scissor with
them. I role play dodging his attacks, but since I don’t know the rules I shout
that I’m “dodging” when I do it. I get hit by the blades, grazed just barely,
and we stop to take note of the damage on my character. People start looking up
how much base health Sephiroth has. I ask after the first round and I get hit
whether I get invincibility frames on my dodge or if I should just avoid the
blades altogether. Nobody seems to care. I’m trying to dodge all the attacks
because I know at this point the enemy is undefeatable for story reasons, and I
need to save HP for later.
