Watching a theater play with family & Lisa. The stage has a dark muddy pool in
the front, which the actors swim through, but when an electric current is run
through it it becomes solid. I remark on it to my mom.

<!-- (After Lisa yelled at me IRL for making noise and to let her sleep) Lisa and I
in bed, she catches me looking at ladies on the internet. She becomes very upset
and abusive, she’s threatening to leave. She hits me in the stomach, and I crawl
along some gutter in pain. She’s reading from some future iPad where the screen
is on both sides, and I can see the page is some pop relationship advice column
telling her to leave the relationship. -->

Strange entity after me. Some fleshy monsters pursuing me. I become invisible
and intangible somehow, and float past them, rising through the ceiling. Someone
who looks like Natalie Larin appears on each floor facing me as I rise through
several floors. I stop to talk to her. Says something about a child who had some
sort of nervous disorder. <!-- I watch a medical scan of a penis ejaculating. -->

A battle is going on in the street. I’m hidden behind some barricades that seem
useless, seems like a fine mesh fence with a turret mounted on an extensible
boom. Our group has surrounded another.
