Living in a house with several others. I think matt is present.

A large number of white people show up — MAGA from the looks of it. They’re
wearing ballistic vests and have sunglasses on. They have a fleet of vehicles
each bringing something like big grills, other stuff for outdoor recreation.
They park on our lawn and begin to party. I think they’re related to one of our
housemates so they think they had the right to do this — else were pushing our
boundaries for their amusement.

They get sloshed pretty fast. I go out to meet them and try to be a “good host”
even though I didn’t invite them and don’t know who they are.  Eventually
they’re sleeping, scattered about the lawn.

One of the partygoers says they’ll get me to do some activity which involves
slithering on a slippery pier in a specific way — I say no thanks, id rather not
get splinters in my penis.

Something about ghosts in the walls. There’s someone talking about them in a
university.
