In winter. I had my old insight and bad winter tires, sliding around all over
the place. Needed to turn around and I just did it by spinning.

Lots of people I don’t know. I’m alone basically except for his friends.

I’m depressed. Not sure why I’m there to begin with. He leaves with his friends,
I’m moping around the crowd that remained. A girl orders a peppermint tea. I
replace the tea carafe even though this is like a gas station deli, and I find
the tea bags were thrown in unopened.
