Flying in an airship. A fat turkey alights on the (dock?). It has the ability to
detach its head from the body, and comes inside. The head was acting like a cat.

We debated whether to eat the body for thanksgiving. What would we do with the
head?

Angela, my old advisor, was seeking to replace her body parts with those of her
grad students. Cat was there; maybe she wanted her eyes. I was to sign over my
legs. I came up to the touch panel where I could give final confirmation to lose
my legs, looking down into a valley from the sky. I selected no.

We left her airship for another one. This one had a bunch of thugs, and I’m on
edge because of the limb trade. We get knives and axes and force them off the
ship, or at least contain them.
