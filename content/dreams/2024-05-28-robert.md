Super vivid. Robert living on campus, and I was expecting to go back to live at
UNL for a two year graduate degree. Lisa was here touring the campus. We saw
Sara the fitness trainer from PGR, but also another “fitness trainer” who was
named steven but he was teaching git and he looked sort of like daniel day lewis
with a pony tail. I’m thinking he was an old professor of mine. I stop to ask
steven where he was teaching, what his schedule was.

My moms here too, shes driving me and lisa. I look over to see that we didn’t
forget lisa. Moms driving my stick shift car.

In Roberts student housing, it’s split into two very small bedrooms that open up
into a larger living space. It’s clear hes just moved in, and I have a bunch of
stuff strewn about as if I was crashing for a day or so. He was clearly up late
and just woke up, asking if id made any coffee. I hadn’t but I rummaged around
looking for some to make. A cat found me, presumably roberts cat, it liked me.

Earlier I was looking at gas signs and stuff to gauge cost of living. It dawned
on me that I could share the space with robert. I ask when hes got the space and
for how long. He said he would have it for about two years which is perfect. I
give him finger guns and he says I think I have your solution.
