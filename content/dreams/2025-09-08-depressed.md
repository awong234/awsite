Was playing a game with andrew and clay from work. Michael Vuong from work was
there too.

Andrew was asking something rather mathematical. I gave my answers but clay kept
correcting the notation, even if the meaning was pretty understandable. I felt
bad and stopped contributing. Mike asked if I was ok. I was unresponsive.

We were making milkshakes later. Lots of blending, weighing, mixing. Mine mustve
been a coffee ice cream milkshake. Ended up grinding part of a metal container,
poor design.

# IRL context

No cpap for a few hours, vivid dreaming.
