Visiting a new doctor. Thinking about GLMs and scrolling through my billing and
stuff while I wait.

I guess I was already on an examining table because a doctor came out from
behind curtains on the right side and began his exam.

He started palpating my abdomen — with his elbow, which hurt. He asked about my
abdominal issues, I told him lower right quadrant usually gives me issues.

Then he stuck a tongue depressor in my mouth. He’s pushing my tongue down hard,
and I struggle to keep my mouth open. He sees it as me challenging him so he
pushes down and in harder. I’m nearly on my back now as I grab the tongue
depressor and try to stop him. He does not. I awake.
