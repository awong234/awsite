City built on the ocean.

We’re in our Fairhill house, it’s one of the cities.

In the mud porch, the window looks forced open.

Move to another house. Sport drops something in front of me, I get a text, from
sport, on my iPhone 13. It reads “I think this was part of a gun.” Sure enough,
it was.

Doing laundry. The washer was built into our new fridge.

Move to the next house. I’m on edge. I get my BB pistol. Some Asian girl walks
by. We draw on each other and start firing. Her dad walks up and I realize she’s
no killer. He asks if that was a real gun. Of course not.

Going back to the first house to reassess evidence of a threat. Meet someone
along the way who asks if sport really texted me. Of course he did, here it is
on my iPhone 13. But I could not find the text. YouTube starts playing stupid
videos and does not stop.

Walk by a pier full of dozens of people fishing in a line. One angry man casts
his line with all his might, biffing it off the platform and dragging another
girl down. Damn.
