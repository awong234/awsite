Matthew was going to this church. It was near our nyc house, walking distance. I
started to go and must’ve gone a few times given some of the papers that I had.
Something about the pastor I did not like. We were talking about eating people,
and for whatever reason they were trying to persuade me it was ok. I finally
wore down and said fine in emergency situations but not outside that. But they
seemed to include eating people in their religion.

I get back into the sermon hall and the pastor is getting ready. He makes a
comment about my stuffed nose saying there were treatments for that. Idk why it
bothered me, I decide I need to get out of there. I’m packing up all my papers
and going home, which was just walking distance away. I’m thinking how I’m going
to make money; theres a video game where we can steal things virtually so maybe
that.

I find a that the pastor sent some thugs after me. I turn into a piece of gum to
hide, but I flop away too soon and the thug sees me and starts yelling “g-unit!”
