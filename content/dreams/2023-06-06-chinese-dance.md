Sort of a dance competition. One girl dances and shatters her front teeth.
They’re held on like windshield glass; she presses against them to show me. Her
black lipstick stains the shattered pieces. She’s made up like a gerudo, with
heavy eyeliner.

Another girl goes next with someone I know from High School. They win the
competition. First girl recognizes her skill, and is a good sport considering
her condition and she was favored to win. The boy who won puts his hand up
against mine, it looks like he had his ring finger removed and transplanted onto
the same hand between his thumb and forefinger.
