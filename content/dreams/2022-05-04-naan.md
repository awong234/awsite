Dreamt I was leaving adk for good again, but it was also Cleveland. Wanted to
eat best food before leaving. Tried to go to best gyros but closed. Tried to get
some naan meal somewhere else, but the baker would not sell me any of the six
naan or so left on the counter.

I asked why he wouldn’t sell it, he gave some odd noncommittal answer. Another
customer came up to him and asked what the price would be to sell all six or
eight naan, he said $80. I asked if the stranger wanted to split it and he said
yeah.

I purchase the naan in spite. The baker says I have the opposite of a poverty
brain if I could do that. Guy couldn’t pick up I was buying his shit out of
spite. I must have reached home because I was telling Lisa about it, but she
sided with the baker, apparently going so far as to update some social media
with the baker’s outlook/perspective/lifestyle which he called omasoma or some
shit, fuck that guy.
