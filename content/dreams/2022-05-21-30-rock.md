Live GTA with Andrew, he summons some cars for us to drive. MCII level racing.

Walking over rooftop w Lisa playing Liz lemon. I remember thinking about how
this is like the dreams I hate with lots of elevation and falling as I work my
way down the side of a roof.

Get to street level NYC, walk up to streeet performer, Lisa wants to help make
then money.

Jokingly punched holes in their box, change their act somehow. Street performer
pays himself to make it seem worthwhile.

Nypd interested in keeping track of ping pong balls, 30 rock music playing over
dozens of balls on tracks moving around. Fred Armisan from SNL playing some sort
of hungry hippo in the middle.
