Lisa and I were traveling. In an old building, perhaps a hotel, but the building
had some structural damage. Soon, an earthquake begins and we can see and feel
the building swaying.

We get down to street level, get in our tiny rental golf cart and drive away. I
took the cart to the cart depot for some reason.

I also remember earlier robert taking me to a japanese place, and ordering some
gluten snack. Others had the same thing, it was a long roll of “protein” and
they dabbed it on the piles of powdered sugar on the tables.
