Matthew came with me to Claims control picnic. He was telling a story about how
I must’ve been some sort of asshole or stupid. I was embarrassed.

I get on the phone with him to discuss exactly what went down. Something about a
campsite, and how I wanted to take a picture of the food so when we reached our
destination we’d have something to throw on the grill (naturally).

Eventually we end up nearby and I’m telling folks how sensible this is,
obviously you take the food along with you in a photo. We’d done the same with
the picnic, after all. I was met with nods and sounds of approval. Someone said
something about encouraging disagreement (this is some corporate DEI thing; I
was way too mad for this to be simple disagreement). We start walking away and I
turn around and take a picture of the campsite, presumably to bring something
along with me. I was sure my brother would be missing something as he did not
take a photo.

Previously, we had a DEI module. Joe Tesoro was there. Someone was presenting. I
think I had to talk because I was writing notes in a small notepad.

Much earlier was eating Korean food, mins family had a restaurant. I ordered at
the last minute, not sure what. Probably some barbecue.

Some sort of military ceremony after. Someone was being honored. I leaned over
to the person next to me and said “not to joke around too much, but what does HP
UP mean in this context?” I was referring to a strange badge he’d earned.
Probably increased his HP, I thought that was funny.
