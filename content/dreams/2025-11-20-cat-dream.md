In our attic, looking around with a flashlight to make sure water from a
rainstorm isnt going anywhere bad. I peer over a railing into darkness with a
flashlight. At the bottom I see old junk, but looking farther and farther I see
buildings in the darkness. A cat the size of a jaguar strolls into the light,
and it has what looks like many kittens all over its bum. I wasnt sure if they
were alive. I remark it must be living on mice down there.

Lisa says there has to be a way in down there so we get in our car and look for
the ramp that would take us there.
