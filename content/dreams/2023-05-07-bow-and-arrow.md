Some sort of chemistry exam coming up. Asked Matt how he did, since he took it
earlier. I don’t think he was optimistic. I was hoping my AP chem would kick in
for it.

Dreamt in some sort of puzzle game like escape the backrooms. Pulled the wrong
lever and half a dozen monsters came out to kill me. Level reset, and I pull the
right levers.

I ask a person nearby if I could take their simple bow from their bag, like the
one from the Forest. I go through the newly opened door.

I come into a large auditorium and sit down. A teacher of some sort comes down
the aisle and is asking everyone to shoot the dog that she has on a plate; high
score is 200 hits. I’ve only got 2 arrows and we can’t retrieve them so I feel
underprepared. People are catching other peoples arrows as they’re shot. One guy
volleys at my aisle, shooting from the back to the front. I slouch down the in
my seat to avoid getting hit.

The “teacher” with the “dog” comes by and I remark on the cruelty, but the “dog”
is really just a rubber ring with holes in it for the arrows to stick into.
