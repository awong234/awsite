New house, more like a farmhouse. Lisa is going to decorate for the fall and
wants to put hay bales in the space partially open to the outside. Theres a
wooden staircase that goes up and to the second story of the farmhouse. Lisa
unfortunately brought the smallest size of hay bales possible so she had to get
more bigger ones. Some man says we can come to him for help.

She comes back again and this time has a retractable ethernet cable. It’s an
interesting thought but I’m not sure where it’s to be used. I look around the
second story part — theres some old TV cables that descend through the floor
into the house proper. I tug on them and they give way, but they’re filthy. I’ll
do it later.

Later I’m eating. A fat man to my right overeats and throws up all over, hitting
my plate. I scrape off his vomit, and a little extra to be safe.
