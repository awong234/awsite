At Ania’s house.

Had several weapons, defending hallway against nazis or something. The hallway
was extremely long. Ended up with two pistols.

Scenario changes slightly. I’m back in Ania’s house. Notice an acquaintance
talking with strangers. I figure the best way to make money is to pretend
acquaintance is a mugger and scare him off with the pistols, and we collect
reward money.

Toward the entrance of the apartment, some friends come in. I offer to do
something for them, something food related. They decline.

Scene jumps, we’re near a little cafe run by Gustavo Fring. Since it’s so low
stakes I joke to Walter white to my left about how much crystal rock candy is
selling nowadays. He is upset, and puts a needle in my ballsack, similar to the
feeling when they were numbed during a vasectomy. He inserts it twice. I’m
frozen, not wanting to move an inch.

Scene jumps. Lisa has shaven my beard off, leaving me with an ugly, patchy, thin
chinstrap. I note it’s uglier than the beard. She shrugs it off, like she had
just acted impulsively and I should accept it.
