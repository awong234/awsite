Hanging with andrew.

He said he’s made a concoction that will make you super intelligent, but he’s
not sure if it will work or what the side effects are. He offers it to several
people in the group. I think Hannah Kim and Jenny Yang from high school we’re
present. All drank except me, I didn’t think the risk was worth it. I ask what’s
in it, jokingly suggesting tuarine, guanine, caffeine; andrew gets it and
retorts “lol yeah, like maybe I accidentally made Red Bull”. He mentioned it’s
50% alcohol, and was the only way to keep the solution stable. I consider
keeping a vial in my fridge until after I’ve witnessed the side effects.

We go for a drive. Walking up and down a hilly slope in a city. Stop into a shop
or two. I realize I have a beard, and it must be strange for my high school
friends to see me with it. I ask Andrew what his plans were after, he said they
were all going to extract all of their cash and try to make it big with their
money. I joked that he was going to accidentally cause a run on the bank.

I thought maybe I left my glasses at home, but no they were hanging on a loop
around my neck. I put them on. I check my watch; it’s like 6:30, and I think I
should be going home to dinner. But I haven’t lived at home since before
Nebraska, I remarked to Andrew, and I found it odd that I felt the urgency to
get home. I looked at the watch again; it was 8:00pm, but it was bright and
sunny like 12 noon. I chalked it up to summertime. The second-hand moved faster
as it passed the 12hour mark, slowing down after passing it.
