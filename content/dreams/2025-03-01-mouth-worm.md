I had my covid hair back, it was shoulder length. I also had a full beard and
giant mustache. My hair was styled a little bit though, turning up at the ends
like a 2000s hair style.

My mouth had little white things sticking out of it though. On closer
inspection, scratching some of it off, I found they were little caterpillars in
white cases/cocoons. There were several of them, and several more down in the
gums. Terrifying.
