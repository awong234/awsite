Scientific group working on Covid, but very unscientific and really just a bunch
of older ladies.

Left this house and went down a rooftop area. Landed near a car on a tight roof
and figure the car had to have gotten there somehow, found a slope down.

Some guy comes out threatens me with a gun. I knew he wouldn’t shoot me, so I
continue on like nothing. He gives up, and becomes friendly.

A group on the rooftop is trying to damage rats like they’re enemies in an RPG.
I try my hand; I do next to no damage to the rat. Someone else has trapped a rat
under his hand and it’s scrambling and scratching to get out.

I look at some Covid guidelines and see one of the recommendations is to be
aware of the angels, and it felt very nightvale.
