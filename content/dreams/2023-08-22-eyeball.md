Dreamt I had a bullet fragment lodged in my eyeball. It wasn’t painful, but it
was annoying. I had tried to get it out with a magnet the second day, but it
didn’t come out, the cornea had healed and it was just pushing against the
cornea. I stopped and figured a doctor should do it.

I visit some places I “typically” go (none of which I really typically go). One
place hired young summer teenagers to do everything; ok for picking up medicine
maybe but not for surgery. The other place took a look at my eye and asked if I
had cataracts; no, I said, it’s actually a bullet. They placed some device on my
eyeball, and began to extract it. I was concerned but let them do it. I was
having second thoughts and wanted the Cleveland Clinic to do it but never did
it. Dream ended before it could be removed.
