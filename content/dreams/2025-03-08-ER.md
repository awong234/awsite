Went to the ER, but it wasnt for anything especially urgent. As a policy, those
not requiring immediate care needed to demonstrate their commitment to staying
by swallowing a cup containing a lubricant, and a nasal canula that was to be
pulled through the nasal cavity somehow after swallowing. What I didn’t realize
was that upon arrival I guess they just automatically put you under and
intubated you, because I had difficulty swallowing with the tube down my throat.
Realizing this, I began to panic, wanting the tube removed asap.
