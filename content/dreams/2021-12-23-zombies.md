Old church like setting.

Heavy rains.

Had my hatchet and axe.

Drank / ate something that could bring you back if you had the right ingredients
to make you again.

Basement flooded, all my things in the water, saw my hiking pack w gps float
away.

Before zombies we had to defend against another team of people. Melee combat.

Zombies came later, after during fight. Axed them. Outside, saw several of them
scale the cliff into the church grounds. Confronted them on the grounds. Lisa
managed to get a weapon from one of them, i kept using the axe.
