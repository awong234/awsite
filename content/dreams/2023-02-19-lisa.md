<!-- Dreamt of our relationship in college. Lisa was a sex worker and had a client
meeting later in the week. Asked if it was ok for her to go, she had a very
talented coworker and didn’t want to miss it. She wanted me to go with her. Our
relationship was ending because school was ending, so I said yes. Very tearful
last day together, I told her I loved her. Strangely enough, she was servicing a
client as we spoke. I didn’t care though, because I loved her. -->

We had been watching movies and the last movies we decided to watch were the
marvel movies, I was disappointed by that. My bunk bed was on the precipice of a
cliff, and I was laying face down on a plank of cliff just wide enough for my
body. I was googling marvel movies to see which ones we had to see to understand
the whole thing. Dreamt I saw the thing from fantastic 4 as if a scene from the
movie.

Prior dream, there were riots, a rebellion, police were forcibly apprehending
people’s phones and beating them for it. I was with the people, but almost a
neutral party. Before the riot I was asked by some tik toker to shoot some golf
thing on camera; I said I was aiming for the big O in the sign across the way,
and that I’d fuck it up because I don’t play golf. I had to hit a wide wiggly
disc, so if course it went nowhere. Laughs.

The police came later. We fought, and I believe we were cornered at the end.
This must have been a rural area because I pleaded with the police about their
shared history with the citizens as long-standing Americans, unlike myself,
there seemed to be some cooling down.
