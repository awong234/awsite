Trying to date Lisa. She said that it’d be best if we didn’t, I forget the
reason. I said, problem was, we’re already married. She said, but that was for
fun / the fun part! Still we can’t date.

Looking for some sort of router. Friend hands me an old one, I’m looking for a
newer one. Find a big long black one with blue lights, this is the one. It’s for
ATT fiber at home in NYC.
