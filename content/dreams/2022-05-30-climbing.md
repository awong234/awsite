Crawling up a large steep hill with family, plus Lisa. Did we have rifles? Grass
was wet. Matthew ahead of me slips and slides down into me, have to start again.

On a ship. Locked into a room by several people with hockey sticks. Maybe it was
a game, I had a hockey stick too. My name was called, I twirl my hockey stick
and head into the hall. Asked a question, and answer it. I tell the person I
thought they were going to ask me to show my submechanophobia underwear, of
which I had several pairs, _of course_.
