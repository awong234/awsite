Traveling, possibly to NY, possibly with Sohum. We’re getting something to eat,
but we’re in something that looks like Campus 2, but also it looks more like an
adult chuck e cheese. There was a slightly dark ambiance with deep blue tones
but brightly lit spaces for hanging out and eating.

We pass by a sushi area. They’re basically preparing and serving heinens sushi.
Nevertheless I want some, so I grab it. I see some of the staff scraping a lot
of sauce from a prep counter with chefs knives.

Suddenly eric fan shows up, which is why I believe I’m in NY, and decides to toy
with me and bully me. He grabs one of the chef’s knives, but this one is very
angular, trapezoidal, and serrated. He swings it at me dangerously quickly. I
grab a knife of my own for defense, to attempt to block some of the attacks
while moving away.

I back all the way down the hallway but eric continues in pursuit. We reach the
very end where there are some people sitting around like it’s a student union,
but I am still evading eric’s attacks. I wake.
