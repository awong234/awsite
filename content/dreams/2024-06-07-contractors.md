Cars in the driveway but the driveway is a crumbling ruin of stone and rusted
rebar. I’m worried it will fall on our cars. Lisa’s car actually has a ruinous
floor above it that will surely fall soon.

Contractors are over my house. They’re a bunch of men my age, but feels like
they’re high schoolers. Theres something about them here to paint, something
about an eye doctor ordering dark walls for the house. I’m not entirely sure why
they’re here though so I’m nervous. I ask if they can take a look at the deck
while they’re here.

One of the contractors starts commenting on how miserable ive been treating my
car, ive scratched it all up. It’s not true, and I’m offended so I decide to
have them leave. They try to stick me with a cancellation fee even though we
hadn’t agreed on anything.

At some point, was on the pc and coura was talking about statistical modeling.

## IRL context

At this time we were rebuilding our deck.
