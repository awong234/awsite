The scientific name for moose is *Alces alces*. I had the idea to reserve this
domain name around 2015, while I was studying the New York Adirondack moose
population during my Master's program at Cornell; I never got around to it but
finally did so January 2020 (yay!).

The genus *Alces* is an anagram for my own name, and it felt almost too fitting
in a preordained sort of way. I still feel fortunate and grateful for the
experience that I was given, and for the mentorship of my advisor [Angela
Fuller](https://blogs.cornell.edu/fullerlab/), and the rest of my laboratory and
friends there.
