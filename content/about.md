title: About Me
---

I grew up in Queens, New York City, went to undergrad at UNL, graduate school at
Cornell, and now am living in Cleveland working for Progressive Insurance. My
main hobbies are PC games & photography, and this year I've picked up
espresso-making.

# The Website

The scientific name for moose is Alces alces. I had the idea to reserve this
domain name around 2015, while I was studying the New York Adirondack moose
population during my Master’s program at Cornell; I never got around to it but
finally did so January 2020 (yay!).

The genus Alces is an anagram for my own name, and it felt almost too fitting in
a preordained sort of way. I still feel fortunate and grateful for the
experience that I was given, and for the mentorship of my advisors [Angela
Fuller](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/angela-fuller) (USGS), [Andy
Royle](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/andy-royle) (USGS), [Jeremy Hurst](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Jeremy-E-Hurst-2209388610)
(NYDEC), and the rest of my laboratory and friends there.

I graduated from my Master’s degree in Quantitative Ecology in 2018, and have
since moved to Cleveland, OH, where I am now a data analyst at Progressive
Insurance, working on the Staffing and Efficiency agenda in Claims.

# Professional Interests

I am interested in websites and how they're put together. I never did the whole
Myspace thing so I feel like I got a very late start into writing HTML. And at
this point, does anyone really write HTML anymore? This website uses:

- `hugo` with the [terminal](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) theme to generate websites from markdown.
- Some `PHP` from [novaGallery](https://novagallery.org/).
- A teensy bit of R Markdown compiled locally to markdown.
- Server running PHP 7 and Apache2.



## Statistics & Machine Learning

Applications of spatial data in particular has always interested me; kriging,
Gaussian processes, and more recently convolutional neural networks.

I enjoy learning new methods where I can, and employing what I know at work.

I'd say I'm competent with:

- Bayesian MCMC hierarchical models
- GLM's
- GAM's

I'd like to learn more about:

- Time series modeling
- Neural networks

## Programming

I am extremely familiar with R, comfortable in Python. I do some bash scripting
and operating in linux environments at work and home.

On github, I have contributed bug-fixes to the R packages `boxr`, `import`, `keyring`, and `emphatic`

## Teaching & Presentations

I have found that sharing knowledge has been a common and rather satisfying
thread in my career. I have always identified as a scientist, and whether I end
up back in science or remain in business, I will always value the scientific
culture of sharing in discovery.
