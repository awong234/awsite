title: About Me
---

I grew up in Queens, New York City, went to undergrad at UNL, graduate school at
Cornell, and now am living in Cleveland working for Progressive Insurance. My
main hobbies are PC games & photography, and this year I've picked up
espresso-making.

# The Website

The scientific name for moose is Alces alces. I had the idea to reserve this domain name around 2015, while I was studying the New York Adirondack moose population during my Master’s program at Cornell; I never got around to it but finally did so January 2020 (yay!).

The genus Alces is an anagram for my own name, and it felt almost too fitting in a preordained sort of way. I still feel fortunate and grateful for the experience that I was given, and for the mentorship of my advisor Angela Fuller, and the rest of my laboratory and friends there.

I graduated from my Master’s degree in Quantitative Ecology in 2018, and have since moved to Cleveland, OH, where I am now a data analyst at Progressive Insurance, working on the Staffing and Efficiency agenda in Claims.

# Professional Interests

## Statistics

From point processes to kriging, spatial analysis has long been an interest and a focus for my work. Ecological applications are numerous, including the spatially-explicit capture-recapture models of my thesis, and a project involving modeling of infection of a parasite in deer scats as a marked point process.

In business, time-series analysis is de rigueur so my future curriculum will incorporate more of this.

## Programming

I am extremely familiar with R, comfortable in Python. I'm currently having a lot of fun with bash scripting and operating in linux environments.

I am just a little obsessed with git, having tried to introduce it to two of my teams now.

On github, I have contributed bug-fixes to the R package `boxr` using pull requests from a forked repo.

## Teaching

I have found that sharing knowledge has been a common and rather satisfying thread in my career. I have always identified as a scientist, and whether I end up back in science or remain in business, I will always value the scientific culture of sharing in discovery.
