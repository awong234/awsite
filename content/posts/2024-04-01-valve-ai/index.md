Sam Bankman-Fried, formerly convicted of various counts of fraud and released
from prison early in 2027, has purchased Valve Corp. and lays out his vision for
the future. "We're taking the Steam platform in an entirely new direction", the
51-year-old entrepreneur said. Bankman-Fried will focus efforts on providing a
premiere platform for AI-generated content. "There are so many ideas that AI can
help us explore", said Bankman-Fried during our visit to his 100,000 sq.ft. estate,
his voice reverberating across the grand hall.

Bankman-Fried intends to allow users to buy AI NFT licenses, which will grant them
partial entitlement to revenue produced by their very own AI game-producer. As
more players purchase their AI's generated content, revenue is shared with the
user who minted the AI developer. Bankman-Fried will unveil the platform in early
2036, code-named "Project Terra". Valve will be taken public soon after in Q1
2037, and every shareholder will be given a free AI Developer NFT token. "We
want to democratize game production and share profits with everyone", said
Bankman-Fried, pausing briefly to lap caviar-topped truffle ice cream off of his
gold-plated cone.

Earliest among these AI-generated content creators was Pocket-Pair, which
released the game "Palworld" in 2023 pioneering AI-generated content in video
games. Pocket-Pair has since released 22 games of slightly varying flavors
generated completely by AI, producing immense revenue at little cost. We reached
out to Pocket-Pair for a comment. "Certainly, I can answer that for you! It was
hard finding talent, and even harder to keep them paid. Now we just have to make
sure our AI servers are provisioned well enough that something good is produced
every year. It costs a fraction of a single human developer", the Tokyo-based
CEO Takuro Mizobe's AI avatar told us in a video interview. Takuro Mizobe
himself has not been seen in public for six years, leading to speculation that
he may not be leading the company any longer and that there may not be any human
employees remaining at Pocket-Pair.
