Ownership is the bedrock of the capitalist framework. An entity might possess
resources, and the entity is entitled to all value that these resources may
generate. What does it mean to own something, and are there better ways of
framing ownership?

## Ownership as what you can defend

Abstractly, ownership is not much more than that which an entity can reasonably
defend from possession by others. If someone has taken a resource you own, you
don't own it any longer until you can exert a force to repossess the resource.
If you really cared, you could just go retake the resource and do a better job
defending it next time. It goes without saying that today, social contracts and
the entity of Government with its laws and law enforcement are the potential
force by which most people passively defend their resources.

I suppose this sytem works well enough and is easy to comprehend, although other
more societies have had different views of ownership.

> Our land is more valuable than your money. It will last forever. It will not even perish by the flames of fire. As long as the sun shines and the waters flow, this land will be here to give life to men and animals. We cannot sell the lives of men and animals; therefore we cannot sell this land. It was put here for us by the Great Spirit and we cannot sell it because it does not belong to us. You can count your money and burn it within the nod of a buffalo's head, but only the great Spirit can count the grains of sand and the blades of grass of these plains. As a present to you, we will give you anything we have that you can take with you, but the land, never.

Is this the limit and extent of ownership? If I had enough energy, would I own
the world? A capitalist might say yes, and more of their ilk appear to be
purusing this gambit as time goes on.

If I stole all nuclear armaments and held the world hostage, demanding that all
resources now belong to me, in this simple view of ownership everyone must
acquiesce and say "yes, you own everything".

Better yet, maybe I have some instant killing curse that I can use against any
who would deny me my wishes -- this way I don't have to bluff or lose everything
as well.

But apart from the fear I've generated nearly nothing will have changed.
Commerce will continue to operate without my input, people will continue to go
to work, visit with their friends, and live their lives unchanged by my threats.
I am not everywhere at once -- can I truly own something that I do not
influence? I would have to be omniscient and omnipotent to have influence in all
matters concerning my property and ensure my continued possession in perpetuity.
Falling short of that, all the energy I could muster does not confer ownership
of all things to me because my influence is limited by time and space.

Ownership, then must be limited by the scope of my influence. My ability to
defend possession of something is only one special case of the more general idea
that I must be able to somehow influence that thing in order to own it.
Influence is a pre-requisite for ownership.

## Influence and space-time

Influence decays with time and space. In the temporal dimension, I may have
enough influence to push a boulder off of a cliff _right now_, but as time goes
on each subsequent contact with the ground involves more factors that drown out
what impact I could possibly intend for the boulder.

In the spatial dimension, the extent of my influence is _hard-capped_ by the
width of the observable universe. Clearly I cannot personally travel faster than
light. But even then, I could not send a signal to influence something at the
edge of the universe because vast space is separated by vast time.

Clearly, I cannot "own" anything approaching these reaches for the simple fact
that I cannot influence them, regardless of my power to defend a thing.

## Ownership of a company

Coming back down to earth, we sell "ownership" of companies in the form of
shares. But my influence on the company

## Entitlement to future value of possessions
