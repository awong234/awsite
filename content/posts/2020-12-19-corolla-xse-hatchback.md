No that's not mine -- that's [Super Street's 2018 SEMA build](http://www.superstreetonline.com/features/1812-2019-toyota-corolla-xse-red-light-special/);
a very attractive build in my opinion.

It's my first time getting a new car, and I had a few things in mind while
shopping. Primarily, I wanted a manual transmission -- one of the most
delightful experiences I've had was driving a Vauxhall Corsa through the
Scottish Highlands, wrong-side driving and all. Secondarily, I prefer hatchbacks
for whatever reason; I enjoy having the fold-down seats for whenever I need to
move something bigger than usual, and they're unique enough, particularly in the
case of the Corolla hatch.

## The Drive

The Corolla XSE hatchback in the 6-speed manual was a natural choice given my
preferences. I've driven a few manual-transmission vehicles in my lifetime,
having learned on a 2004 F-250, driven the Vauxhall Corsa in Scotland, and
test-driven a 2019 Civic Type-R -- a set of _very_ different vehicles and
experiences.

The XSE is a huge step up from my previous 2011 Honda Insight (but what wouldn't
be?), without sacrificing _too_ much fuel efficiency, at 37 MPG highway, 25
MPG city. After about 80,000 miles, the Insight's electric engine wasn't picking
up as much slack as it used to, and recent MPG readings were in the mid-30's.

168 HP is enough for my purposes, and provides enough low-end torque to get
through intersections quickly when needed, a spot sorely lacking for the
Insight. Regardless of the car I purchased I probably wouldn't have taken it to
a track, so this is a reasonable level of power for a commuter car.

One oddity I have found with the throttle response is that there is a severe
lack of responsiveness when the clutch is not depressed and not in gear --
meaning that fast double-clutched downshifting is not really an option with this
vehicle. The response is much more reasonable when granny-shifting, although it
doesn't feel better than any of the throttle responses of the mechanical linkage
of the F-250, the ETC of the more comparable Corsa, or the CTR (obviously no
contest there). I noticed this during my test-drive, but I didn't figure it to
be enough of a problem for me to force me to other options.

One feature that I really enjoy (that is strangely absent from the Civic Type-R)
is that the intelligent Manual Transmission (iMT) option for automatic
rev-matching can be activated and deactivated with the push of one button -- the
CTR requires navigation through several menu screens to adjust this. Typically I
imagine I'd keep this off and turn it on when I approach traffic or NYC-type
city driving, so the dedicated physical button just makes sense. That this
vehicle has auto-rev-matching is a happy surprise, and probably a good idea,
since the pedal configuration doesn't feel right for heel-toe maneuvers
(something I have, admittedly, not mastered yet, however).

## Other features

The infotainment screen is passable, made _much_ more satisfactory through the
use of Android Auto. Setup was easy, once I'd figured out that you just need to
activate it through settings, and go through the Projections 'app' to use -- no
downloads needed through the weird Entune app suite.

The suite of intelligent driving assets are not very noticeable, but I'm sure
eventually I will appreciate their vigilance one day. Automatic high-beams are
highly appreciated for back-country driving, so I won't accidentally blind
oncoming traffic (and then feel bad about it).

Yes it's a small car -- I like small cars for parking, particularly whenever I
go back home to NYC -- and this is one of the main criticisms of this Corolla.
This generation's Honda Civic design has a huge interior and cargo space. But I
find the space acceptable, compared to the Honda Insight -- not too much space
feels lost.

There seem to be a lot of available aftermarket parts for the Hatchback (I was
expecting nothing, to be frank) -- eventually I'd like to get the lip kit, and
the A'PEXi exhaust used in the Super Street build of the cover image.

With 0.9% financing, this was a no-brainer, and I'm very happy with this
purchase!
